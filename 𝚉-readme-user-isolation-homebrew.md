# 🏠 Complete User Isolation: Homebrew + Apps + Auto-Config

## The Problem 🚫
Multi-user chezmoi testing = permission nightmares! System-wide Homebrew causes:
- `Permission denied @ rb_sysopen` errors between users
- File ownership conflicts that break installations

## The Solution 🎯
**Fully Isolated User Environments** with automatic configuration:

```bash
# 💩 Traditional (Shared Hell):
/opt/homebrew/     ← Everyone fights over this
/Applications/     ← Apps step on each other

# 😎 Our Approach (Isolated Paradise):
~/.homebrew/       ← Your personal Homebrew
~/Applications/    ← Your personal apps
```

## Magic Auto-Configuration ✨
Our setup automatically configures Homebrew so **every future cask install** goes to your user directory:

```bash
export HOMEBREW_CASK_OPTS="--appdir=$HOME/Applications"
```

This means:
- ✅ `brew install --cask discord` → `~/Applications/Discord.app`
- ✅ `brew install --cask notion` → `~/Applications/Notion.app` 
- ✅ No more `--appdir` flags needed anywhere!

## Benefits 🚀
- **Zero conflicts**: Each user completely sandboxed
- **Auto-magic**: Set once, works forever
- **Clean testing**: Create/destroy users safely
- **Transparent**: Just works like normal Homebrew

## Quick Test 🧪
```bash
# After chezmoi setup, test isolation:
brew install --cask raycast     # Goes to ~/Applications/ automatically
which brew                      # Shows ~/.homebrew/bin/brew
echo $HOMEBREW_CASK_OPTS       # Shows your auto-config
```

## Cleanup 🧹
```bash
# Nuke test user completely (no traces left)
sudo dscl . -delete /Users/testuser && sudo rm -rf /Users/testuser
```

**Result**: Perfect user isolation with zero manual configuration! 🎉
